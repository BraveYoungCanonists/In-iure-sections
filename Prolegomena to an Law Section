# **Rationes in iure**

*Marriage in the beginning*

The institution of Marriage is not the creation of man.  No authority can change or redefine it, even that of the state. God has inscribed marriage into the very structure of his Creation. The whole Creation proclaims the glory of marriage by the very existence of male and female, a wondrous com-plementarity echoed in the poetry of creation whenever unity-in-duality is encountered.
Christ the Lord, in his debate with the Pharisees looking to entrap him by having him contra-dict the Law, confirmed the divine origin of marriage when he said, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder” (Matthew 19:4-6).

Creation is inherently nuptial because marriage, an instinct for which has been planted in our innermost being, orients men and women to the purpose for which God created the universe: welcom-ing all people into the inner life of the God who is love (Catechism of the Catholic Church [CCC] 1, 260). Human beings can only partake of this Trinitarian life of eternal and perfect love, joy, and communion by being brought into the unity of the Body of Christ, which is the Church, by the power of the Holy Spirit (CCC 846). The unity of Christ and his Church, a unity without which our divinization is impossible, is a nuptial or spousal unity (CCC 798). It is for this reason that Saint Paul says, “Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the Church, the body of which he is the Saviour;” (Ephesians 5:22-23) and, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her” (Ephesians 5:25). Marriage is a sign that points to that ultimate reality for all people, and when entered into by Chris-tians is an effective symbol by which the spouses participate, in a special way, in the nuptial dimen-sion of the Paschal Mystery (CCC 1617).

The public discourse concerning the nature of marriage today makes it necessary to declare in a forthright manner what marriage is and what distinguishes it from every other form of human relationship. Saint Thomas Aquinas provides an apt and succinct definition of marriage: marriage is the joining by which certain persons are directed to one begetting and upbringing of children and to one family life (see *Suppl.*, Q. 44, art. 1). Saint Thomas thus defines marriage by the unique effect (the procreation and education of children) to which marriage gives rise, an effect that distinguishes it from all other forms of relationship. The Code of Canon Law takes up this age-old understanding of marriage when it describes what must be minimally known about the definition of marriage in order to be able to consent to it. According to c. 1096 of the Code of Canon Law, “marriage is a permanent partnership between a man and a woman ordered to the procreation of offspring by means of some sexual cooperation.” The Latin word that the Code of Canon Law uses for “partnership” is *consortium*, which comes from the two root words *con-* and *sors*, meaning to share the same lot or destiny. The “lot” or destiny in question goes far beyond financial arrangements or even cohabitation, but is instead the common project of building a family, namely, a project which brings into being the unity of a man and woman’s ancestors and descendants.

Marriage also brings about, by its nature, the good of the spouses themselves. As the Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make a helper fit for him” (Genesis 2:18). As marriage naturally leads to children and their upbringing, so too does marriage naturally lead to the mutual good of husband and wife. Being a social animal, human persons need life in community for their integral good. In addition, the growth in virtue that marriage brings about, as the spouses live day by day in a community oriented by nature to children and family life, leads not only to the full development of the human personalities of the same spouses, but to their mutual perfection and sanctifica-tion, in other words, to their true good.

The true and ultimate good of all men and women is God himself, who is, as Saint Anselm of Canterbury has described him, that than which nothing greater can be conceived. Our Lord himself has shown us the narrow road that leads to this happiness. It is the way of the Beatitudes, indeed, it is the way of the cross. Christ the Lord said that “those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it” (Matthew 19:25). In other words, one’s true good - ultimate happiness and total fulfilment - is not found through individual self-seeking, but is achieved by conforming one’s life to the pattern of divine love made visible in Jesus Christ, the love by which he, who though he was in the form of God, humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross (see Philippians 2:6 8).

## *The consent that makes marriage*

Marriage is ordered to this goodness in a unique way that originates in how marriage comes into existence. The marriage of a man and woman is established by their mutual consent. The Code of Canon law specifies that a man and woman who enter into marriage do so by mutually giving and ac-cepting each other through an irrevocable covenant (see c. 1057, §2). In other words, the consent that makes marriage is the consent to the gift of self. In all our relationships and in all our communities, our good is found only through self-gift, but only one such relationship or community is defined by it, namely, marriage.

Giving involves the transfer of ownership to another. To give one’s self in marriage, however, is not to give the other person total ownership over oneself in the sense of slavery. In addition, this self-gift cannot be to hand over a right over all dimensions of one’s person, as there are many such dimensions that are completely inalienable, such as the personal duty to give praise and glory to God. What is being exchanged is a mutual gift of a very particular and representative right. Following Saint Paul, who taught that “the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; like-wise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does” (1 Corinthians 7:4), an older view understood that what was being exchanged in marriage was a mutual right over the body (i.e. a right to those acts in themselves apt for the generation of children). To speak of a gift of self, however, is to speak of the gift of the right over a dimension of the person that must be so proper as to truly represent him or her. No aspect of one’s person is as uniquely personal as one’s own procreative element. This is the element possessed by each and every human being within which the bodily human life of every ancestor of the person since the creation of the world is enfolded. Indeed, the mutual exercise of this reciprocal right in the conjugal act (i.e. the consummation of the marriage) is the only means by which that procreative element unique to each spouse can be fruitful and multiply as the two elements join to truly become “one flesh” – their child.

Therefore, the two purposes of marriage that are proper to its nature – the procreation and education of children and the good of the spouses – are mutually implicative and are both aspects of the same reality. In the traditional understanding, the good of the spouses was the result of marriage as essentially defined by its natural procreative capacity. The procreativity of marriage, on the other hand, is now seen to arise from the essential orientation of marriage to the good of the spouses. The good of man can only be attained by the gift of self in self-outpouring love. Marriage is the only human relationship that is essentially constituted by this mutual gift of self, a gift that follows the logic of divine love. This reciprocal gift is the exchange of the right to the procreative element of each spouse as uniquely representative of the self. The exercise of this right leads, naturally, to the procreation and education of children. 

Marriage comes into existence by the consent of the man and the woman to become husband and wife. A man and woman, “once they consent to marry one another, introduce a new element into their relationship: that of justice. The former elements drawing them together - attraction, affection, love (or perhaps mere interest) - now coalesce into a juridical commitment and bond. By consent-ing to be husband and wife, they mutually confer rights and acquire obligations, both due in justice and both of a permanent nature” (C. BURKE, “The Object of Matrimonial Consent: A Personalist Analysis,” in Forum, 9 [1998], pp. 39-117).

## *Consent is a human act*

14. The consent that makes marriage is, of necessity, a human act. The consent to a radical gift of self clearly cannot be made by anyone other than the man or woman whose conjugal sexuality is being donated. Also, such consent must be freely willed in a human manner.  Those elements that are re-quired for any truly human choice are thus necessary, a fortiori, for the decision to give one’s own self in marriage. A man or woman, in some minimal way, must understand that to which they are consenting, namely the reciprocal gift of self as defined, in a juridical manner, by the exchange of the right to conjugal sexuality, if they are to establish marriage. They must be able to evaluate critically those rights and duties without which there is no true reciprocal gift of self. They must also be unaffected by strong internal compulsions that would compromise, in a substantial way, their freedom to choose to assume these rights and duties.
