# *In iure* sections

## Purpose

Programmers write code. Canonists write *in iure* sections. This area can be used to share elements of *in iure* sections of judicial sentences, *animadversiones* of Defender's of the bond, advocate briefs, and so on. These can be cloned, reworked, and re-contributed as you see fit. The goal isn't to produce one, perfect, *in iure*, section, but rather to let canonists communicate and contribute in a forum where all can immediately benefit from the work of one another.
